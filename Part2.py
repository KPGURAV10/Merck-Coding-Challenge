"""Deciphering the structure of the binary chromatography data and crafting Python programs to convert them into CSV format.
Here's a general approach that you can adapt to each dataset folder:

Part (b): Determining Data Storage in Binary Form (Markdown format)
File Header Analysis:
hex editor or binary analysis tool to examine the first few bytes of the binary file. This may reveal a signature or magic number that identifies the file format.
Look for patterns like specific byte values or sequences that might indicate data type information (e.g., floating-point numbers, integers, etc.).

Data Size Exploration:
If the file size is consistent across samples, it suggests a fixed-size data structure for each sample's data points.
Consider the information provided in the accompanying .csv file. The number of columns and data points can offer clues about how the binary data is organized.

Byte Order Detection:
Check for byte order markers (BOM) in the header to determine if little-endian or big-endian byte ordering is used. If no BOM is present, experiment with both orders to see which one produces meaningful data when used with your decoding logic.

Data Type Identification:
Based on the expected data types (time, intensity, wavelength, absorbance, mass), look for patterns in byte sequences that might correspond to these data types. Common representations include single-precision (4 bytes) or double-precision (8 bytes) floating-point numbers, or signed/unsigned integers (1-4 bytes).

Part (c): Python Program for Binary-to-CSV Conversion (one .py file per dataset)
Example Structure (pear_challenge.py): """

import csv

def decode_pear_challenge(binary_file, csv_file):
  """
  Decodes binary data from 'binary_file' and writes decoded values to 'csv_file'
  in a format matching the provided CSV file for the 'pear challenge' dataset.

  **Note:** This function requires further customization based on your analysis

  Args:
      binary_file: Path to the binary file containing chromatography data.
      csv_file: Path to the output CSV file.

  with open(binary_file, 'rb') as f_bin, open(csv_file, 'w', newline='') as f_csv:
    # Replace the following with your decoding logic based on data format analysis
    # (e.g., read header, determine data types, handle byte order)
    data = []  # List to store decoded data points
    for line in f_bin:
      # Decode each line (e.g., convert bytes to appropriate data types)
      data.append(decoded_value)

    writer = csv.writer(f_csv)
    # Write header row (assuming headers are present in the CSV)
    writer.writerow(header_row)
    writer.writerows(data)  # Write decoded data rows

# Replace with the actual paths to your binary and CSV files
binary_file = "path/to/pear_challenge.bin"
csv_file = "path/to/pear_challenge_decoded.csv"

decode_pear_challenge(binary_file, csv_file)
print("Converted pear_challenge data to CSV format.")

"""

Explanation:

The decode_pear_challenge function takes the binary file path and output CSV file path as arguments.
It opens both files for reading (binary) and writing (CSV with newline character handling).
The core logic for decoding the binary data needs to be replaced with your specific implementation based on the format analysis from part (b). This might involve reading a header, determining data types and byte order, and converting bytes to appropriate values.
The decoded data points are stored in a list (data).
A CSV writer object is created, and the header row (assuming one exists in the reference CSV) is written.
Finally, the decoded data rows are written to the CSV file.
Repeating for scale_challenge.py and sixtysix.py
